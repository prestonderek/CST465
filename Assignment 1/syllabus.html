    <h3>Grading</h3>
    <p>The final grade will be determined from the following breakdown:</p>
    <table>

        70&#37;&#43;&nbsp;&#45;&gt;&nbsp;C&#59;&nbsp;60&#37;&#43;&nbsp;&#45;&gt;&nbsp;D&#59;&nbsp;
        Less than 60&#45;&gt;&nbsp;F
    </p>
    <h3>Assignments</h3>
    <p>
        Assignments are typically exercises or small programs that deal with
        implementing a specific aspect within web development. The due date of all
        assignments will be announced when they are assigned. Late assignments will be
        given a 20&#37; penalty for each day it is late. After 5 days, no credit will be given.
    </p>
    <h3>Discussions</h3>
    <p>
        Most weeks will feature a discussion topic based on the reading for the term
    </p>
    <h3>Quizzes</h3>
    <p>
        Weekly quizzes will be administered in order to reinforce the information that
        was covered for the week.
    </p>
    <h3>Tests</h3>
    <p>
        There will be a mid-term and a final both of which will either be “take-home”
        tests or administered through Canvas. “Take-home” tests will then be
        demonstrated to the instructor for evaluation.
    </p>
    <h3>Cheating</h3>
    <p>
        Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining
        grades under false pretenses. Plagiarism is defined as submitting the language,
        ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of
        plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion. Cheating is defined
        as, but not limited to: obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an
        examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and
        other materials; obtaining or providing unauthorized information concerning all or
        part of an examination prior to that examination; taking an examination for
        another student or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place;
        altering test answers after submittal for grading; changing grades after grades
        have been awarded; or altering other official academic records.
        <br>
        All academic dishonesty cases will be reported to the Vice President for Student
        Affairs.
    </p>
    <h3>Use of AI</h3>
    <p>
        I encourage the use of AI as a learning tool. We will be using it to quickly build
        up various environments, but upon doing so, I expect you to understand what it
        has done. If you do not understand something that AI has built for you, I
        encourage you to ask me, or AI, for clarification. Discussion posts should be
        based on your own knowledge and in your own words.
    </p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous Info:</h3>
    <P>
        If you have a physical, learning, sensory or psychological disability and require
        accommodations, please let me know as soon as possible. You will need to
        register with and, in most cases, provide documentation of your disability to
        Disability Services. This can be done online through the Accommodations tile in
        TECHweb, or by going directly to <a href="https://bachelor.accessiblelearning.com/OIT">https://bachelor.accessiblelearning.com/OIT</a>.
